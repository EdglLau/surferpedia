          <h1>Jake Marshall</h1>
            <p>Many young surfers have the potential to make an impact on our sport but none look more poised to do so than Jake Marshall. Raised on the rippable beachbreaks and reefs of San Diegos North County Jake has developed a solid base of smooth rail work as well as the kind of flair that few 14-year-old surfers can match. His progression is due in no small part to the numerous world-class talents in his neighborhood that have taught him a thing or two about tearing Seaside apart. "I see Rob Machado Josh Kerr Damien Hobgood and Taylor Knox out all the time and its really fun to surf with guys on that level" says Jake. "I look at them and think Thats how I have to surf if I want to make the Tour one day. That really helps me push my limits." Already hes had remarkable success in a jersey including a recent win at the U.S. Surfing Championships at Lower Trestles. But while surf stardom seems inevitable for Jake hes still just a kid and knows where his priorities should be. "I surf and try to improve all the time but I still put a lot of emphasis on school" says Jake. "I know that education is really important and if surfing doesnt work out its always good to have a backup plan".     </p>
